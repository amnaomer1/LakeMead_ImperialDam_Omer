### Summary
This project explores the relationship between Lake Mead water levels and California’s consumptive use of Colorado River water from 2000–2024. Using publicly available elevation and water-use datasets, the analysis evaluates how fluctuations in reservoir storage influence state-level water-use behavior. Methods include correlation and lag testing, response elasticity analysis, and before-and-after comparisons around major policy milestones. Results provide insight into how hydrologic shifts and management actions interact to shape California’s water use under increasing scarcity.
