### Summary
This project analyzes how changes in Lake Mead’s elevation influence California’s water diversions and consumptive use from 2000 to 2024.  
Using U.S. Bureau of Reclamation data, it quantifies how federally defined shortage tiers translate upstream hydrologic variability into downstream water-use responses.  
Through correlation, lag, and piecewise regression analyses the study reveals how shifts in Lake Mead’s elevation shape California’s water allocation under changing hydrologic and policy conditions.
